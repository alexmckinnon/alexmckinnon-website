How I found my way to a career in software development, outlined with an excessive amount of gifs (and a few words too).

### Gone Coastal

Back in 2012 my partner and I moved from Calgary, Alberta, to Vancouver Island on the West Coast of Canada. More specifically, to a smaller island (Gabriola) 5 kilometers off the coast of Vancouver Island.

Thanks to a family friend we secured a house to rent. We bought an SUV with room for ourselves and all our feline family members (4 cats at the time), loaded up a U-Haul trailer, and off we went.

### Retirement... Reality

We didn’t have a lot of money saved up and neither of us had jobs lined up, so after a month of early retirement spent relaxing and taking in the island life we quickly realized it wasn’t going to last. We needed to get back to work and get money coming.

Despite numerous warnings from friends and family before moving that there are no jobs out there, my partner and I both landed jobs on the same day. They were both jobs we really wanted but did not think we were qualified for.

### Customer Service

I was hired as a Customer Service Representative for a local web development company. Although I worked as a freelance web designer in the past, with no formal training and no experience outside of working for myself I didn’t feel qualified to apply for a design/development position. I was thrilled to get a job at an actual web development company and had no idea what that was going to be like.

### Phone Phobia
The customer service department was also the call center for the company and answering phones was a large part of the job. Outside of a few (unsuccessful) days in telemarketing selling newspaper subscriptions I had never worked in a call center environment and quickly learned I had an almost crippling fear of answering calls.

This feeling was a familiar one. I’m an introvert and to some degree also have social anxiety. In the past I’ve attempted jobs well outside my comfort zone such as door to door sales and picking up the phone was just like knocking on doors - I felt physically ill.

Looking back it was a humbling experience. Even though I felt under-qualified when I applied for the customer service position, at the same time I felt I was qualified enough to be a designer or developer. I quickly realized how little I actually knew about almost every aspect of web development. I could write some PHP and understood basic data and control structures (variables, arrays, if/else statements) and could handle basic HTML and CSS but I had little exposure or understanding of everything else. The list of things I didn’t know grew daily: object-oriented programming, command line, DNS, web servers, email, networking, etc…

I dove in. I took a ferry from island to island every day and spent my commute and any free time at home learning as much as I could about the sites and applications I was supporting. I pushed through the phone phobia and eventually, it went away. I no longer hesitated to jump on calls. I discovered a passion for learning and kept diving deep into topics I didn’t understand and continued to build up my skills and knowledge. 

### Educator / Team Lead
![damn good job](https://media.giphy.com/media/RTzd8Kt4glWNy/giphy.gif)

I also discovered a passion for sharing that knowledge and helping others. I quickly excelled as a member of the support department, leading to promotions to Support Educator, and later on the Team Lead the entire Support and IT department. 

### Stepping Back

![homer hides in bush](https://media.giphy.com/media/jUwpNzg9IcyrK/giphy.gif)

Similar to previous positions, as team lead I quickly realized I was outside my comfort zone. Although I had held leadership positions in other industries in the past this was different. And unlike the technical knowledge gaps, I couldn’t quite grasp how to grow my leadership skills and excel in this new role. Eventually, I came to the realization that this wasn’t the right role for me and I stepped down from this position.

### Software Developer
![you fit in here](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4JzfNvdNGPRjyt9u/giphy.gif)

A new path opened up. I continued to provide support and education to the customer service and technical support teams but shifted into a new role creating tools and applications for the support and development team members. I was ready to be a developer. 

Over the course of my time as an internal developer, I focused on automating processes and replacing manual tasks whenever possible. One of the largest projects I worked on was to automate the migration of our web servers from one hosting provider to another. Over the course of this project, I worked extensively with the system administration team and as usual identified a number of knowledge gaps. I dove in again, learning about Unix, cloud services, networking, and eventually found myself as a Certified System Administrator.

### System Administrator

Along with my shiny new system administration skills, I found myself in a new position: System Administrator. I worked on resolving issues with our network, servers, databases, improving system configuration, automating manual tasks, and improving service reliability and monitoring.

### Software Developer (again)

As business needs changed I met with the head of product development to discuss moving into a new role as a software developer working on our core product. By this time I was interested and skilled in both development and operations and had a hard time deciding between the two. I still had a lot to learn on the operations side, but there were new opportunities to learn and grow on the development side, and my experience on the operations side would help bridge the gap between the departments.

![teamwork](https://media.giphy.com/media/dSetNZo2AJfptAk9hp/giphy.gif)

I had been the sole developer on most projects up to this point. In my new role as a software developer, I was on a team collaborating with other developers and designers on the same project together. I was able to collaborate with others in new ways: code reviews, sprint planning, pair programming. I worked with some of the best developers in the company and I was able to directly impact and improve the standards and quality of our core code and core product.

### Looking Back

It’s been over 7 years since I first walked through the doors. I had no idea what that was going to lead to. I discovered a passion for learning, had opportunities to grow and succeed, learned how to overcome fears, learned to fail, worked with countless team members that helped me grow and mentored me along the way, had the opportunity to be a part of a company learning to grow and mature, watched and helped students and junior developers grow into senior roles, and had the opportunity to work on exciting and challenging projects along the way.

### Systems Engineer

It’s time to try something new. I’m looking forward to finding out once again how little I actually know, to collaborate and grow with new team members, to be terrified and step outside my comfort zone, to overcome those fears and to excel in a new environment. I’m heading down a new path as a Systems Engineer with a different company.

I’m excited. I’m nervous. I’m terrified. I’m grateful. I'm ready for the next adventure!
